# ðŸŒŽ Tale of Biomes
Tale of Biomes is a Minecraft mod that I am working on as part of the MCreator Lore series on my YouTube channel NorthWestTrees MCreator. Tale of Biomes adds a new dimension and an entirely new custom world full of new mechanics and features that expand the game's reach. Here you will find snapshots, releases, and documentation for the modification.

NorthWestTrees uses a couple of programs for planning the modification [Leonardo](https://www.getleonardo.com/) and [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) as well as GitHub for feature requests, wiki, and bug tracking. All textures and assets are made by NorthWestTrees and produced using [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/) and [PaintDotNet](https://getpaint.net/). And of course, this would not be possible without [MCreator](https://mcreator.net/) the software used to make the Minecraft mod.

> [!WARNING]
> This Minecraft modification is not been officially released yet and is still considered to be in development. 
> Even though it's mostly stable using the mod in your worlds may result in items being lost or issues with generation. 
> Please keep this in mind when using the mod for your worlds as I am not liable any issues that in result of use before release.
